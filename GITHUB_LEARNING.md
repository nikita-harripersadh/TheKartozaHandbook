# Markdown Summary #
## My experience exploring GitHub: ##

My experience with Github has been limited in nature. Just a short first time experience with simple tasks such as creating a profile on Github and then looking at the Handbook repository and performing the task of forking. 
Also the learning curve of having to learn new terminology for tasks and processes. 

## What i learned about forks, branches, and pull requests: ##
*Fork:* A fork is a clone / copy of another repository into your personal repository. It allows you to make changes without affecting the original repository while also giving credit to the original source.

*Branch:* Branches are independent of the primary branch or main branch, allows users such as developers, to work experimentaly in isolation without affecting the primary branch.

*Pull request*: It is a request that the maintainers of the repository review your changes and, if approved, integrate them into their codebase. Pull requests create code review, discussion, and collaboration before changes are merged.
## A brief overview of Markdown syntax and its uses: ##
Markdown language simplifies formatting plain text by using keyboard strokes. For example, to display a HEADING 1 the Markdown syntax is to precede the plain text word with the Markdown hash tag #HEADING 1. When the text displays in a browser, browsers recognize the Markdown syntax and display the text as HEADING 1.
Its primary purpose is to enable users to write content in an easy-to-read and easy-to-write plain text format, which can then be converted into other formats like HTML.
